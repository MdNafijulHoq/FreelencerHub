#FreeencerHub
This project entails developing a full-stack web application for an online marketplace, focusing on user-friendly design and functionality. The platform will allow users to post job listings and place bids on projects, with three main categories: web development, digital marketing, and graphic design. The website will include features such as:

1. User Authentication: Login and registration with email and Google Sign-In.
2. Job Listings: Users can browse jobs by category, view job details, and place bids.
3. Job Management: Employers can post jobs, manage bids, update or delete job posts.
4. Bidding System: Users can place bids on jobs, with bid details managed through MongoDB.
5. Private Routes: Pages like "My Bids," "My Posted Jobs," and "Bid Requests" will be protected, accessible only to logged-in users.
6. UI/UX Focus: The site will feature a visually appealing design with a customized navbar, footer, and tab-based job browsing using React-tabs.
The application will integrate MongoDB for job and bid data storage and use React, Tailwind CSS, and component libraries (e.g., Daisy UI, Meraki UI) for the frontend design.
